    "# Installation of R Packages via JupyterHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to download all the relevant R packages for our project. Unfortunately, we cannot do this directly in the R kernel within Jupyter Notebooks. Instead, we have to switch to the Python Kernel to execute these commands. Here's why and how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Switch to Python Kernel for `sudo` Commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter Notebooks, the ability to execute certain types of commands, such as those involving `sudo`, is dependent on the kernel in use. A kernel dictates the programming language environment within your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a **Python kernel**, you can run shell commands by prefixing them with `!`. This enables the execution of system-level commands, including those that utilize `sudo`, directly within a notebook cell.\n",
    "- The **R kernel** is tailored for executing R language commands and does not interpret shell commands prefixed with `!` in the same way. As a result, running system commands or those involving `sudo` is not directly supported in an R kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If You Were Using R Locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing R packages on a local machine is usually more straightforward because you have direct access to the terminal or command line, allowing you to execute commands without the constraints of a notebook's kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install an R package locally, you would:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open an R session in your terminal.\n",
    "2. Use the `install.packages()` function with the desired package name.ired package name. For example, installing the `ggplot2` package would look like this : `install.packages('ggplot2')` "

    "### How We Are Going to Install the Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "To streamline the installation of necessary R packages for our data analysis and visualization projects, we have devised a straightforward approach that leverages the capabilities of both Python and R kernels within Jupyter Notebooks. Here is our plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In This Notebook (Using the Python Kernel):**\n",
    "   We will utilize the Python kernel's ability to execute shell commands. This allows us to install R packages system-wide by leveraging the `sudo` command, which grants us the necessary permissions to install packages for all users. The command format we will use is as follows:\n",
