# M02 Machine Learning Course

This repository contains materials and resources for the M02 Machine Learning course. This course provides an exploration of key issues and concepts in machine learning, with an emphasis on practical applications in business and management.

## Course Overview

Students will develop a strong understanding of both predictive modeling and causal inference using machine learning. The course covers regularised regression techniques, tree-based models, deep learning, unsupervised learning, and more advanced topics in machine learning, including causal machine learning and large language models (LLMs).

### Key Topics Include:
- **Predictive Modeling vs Causal Inference**: Understanding the difference between predicting outcomes and identifying cause-and-effect relationships.
- **Regularised Regression**: Techniques like Lasso and Elastic Net.
- **Tree-Based Methods**: Exploration of models such as Random Forest.
- **Resampling Methods**: Bagging, cross-validation, and model performance evaluation.
- **Deep Learning**: Introduction to neural networks and their applications.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- **Advanced Topics**: Causal machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and other emerging techniques.

The course uses a hands-on approach with R, ensuring students gain practical skills in implementing machine learning models.
