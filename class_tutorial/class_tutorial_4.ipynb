    "We analyse political data by examining the voting patterns of the 111th US House of Representatives during the years 2009-2011. We use the *rollcall-votes.Rdata* file, which records whether each of the 445 House members voted \"yea\" = 1, \"nay\" = -1, or abstained = 0 on 1,647 different legislative decisions. In addition, the file *rollcall-members.Rdata* enriches our dataset by providing additional details about the members, including their party affiliation (Republican or Democrat) and the US state they represent.\n",

    "This tutorial promises to give you not only the technical skills to manipulate and analyse large datasets, but also insights into political dynamics and voting behaviour. By the end of this tutorial, you will have hands-on experience in data preparation, exploration and advanced analysis using unsupervised ML. nance."

    "This section focuses on analyzing party composition and voting behaviors in the 111th US House of Representatives. We start by displaying counts and proportions of Democrats, Republicans, and one notable politician. Next, we examine voting participation by counting missing votes and visualizing this data with a histogram to analyze absenteeism patterns. Additionally, we count 'yea' and 'nay' votes, plotting these against each other by party to highlight differences in voting behavior across party lines. This exploration helps us understand the dataset's structure and the political dynamics at play."
